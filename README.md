# heic-converter

Simple App to convert .heic files to a more acceptable format. <br />
I know that there are tons of projects out there that acomplishes this task already, but I wanted to build an interface of my own to practice some React, Typescript and the Composition Pattern.

## Tech
This App is being built using Vite, React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS. <br />
To actually convert the files, I'm using the [**heic2any**](https://github.com/alexcorvi/heic2any) library.

## Upcoming Features
These are features that I plan on adding in the upcoming days:
- Implement tests using React Testing Library;
- Upload and convert multiple files;
- Render preview of the file(s) before saving to the PC;
- Select image format other than .jpg before converting;
- And more...
